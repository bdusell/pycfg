Context free grammar algorithms implemented in Python.

The main goal of this library is to provide utilities for parsing arbitrary
context-free grammars using algorithms based on Masaru Tomita's generalized
LR (GLR) parsing algorithm, and ultimately apply them to natural language
parsing and machine translation.

Development is currently in progress.
