# G5, a non-cyclic grammar which cannot be handled by Tomita's basic GLR
# algorithm and has bounded direct ambiguity of degree 2, in spite of being
# unboundedly ambiguous.
# The degree of direct ambiguity of a non-terminal A with respect to a string
# x is the number of distinct tuples (p, x1, x2, ... , xn), where p is a
# production A -> B1 B2 ... Bn, and x1 x2 ... xn is a factorization of x such
# that Bi =>* xi for 1 <= n.
# A CFG G has bounded direct ambiguity of degree k if the degree of direct
# ambiguity of any of its non-terminals with respect to any string is at most
# k.
